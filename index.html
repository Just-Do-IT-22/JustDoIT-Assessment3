									  My name is Fazil Syed and I'm in team Just Do IT. I was born in Hyderabad, India
										and raised in Melbourne, Victoria where I currently reside with my beautiful wife and two young
										boys. My hobbies are cooking, fishing, traveling, watching movies/TV shows and DJing. I can speak
										both Hindi and Urdu. My interest in IT started at a very early age in the early 90's, and although
										I did do some IT studies approximately 20 years ago, I decided to follow a different career path. My
										interest in IT reignited recently whilst working on some IT related work projects and my own
										personal IT ideas. I felt helpless as I lacked the advanced tools, skills, and knowledge to achieve
										the desired outcome and expanding on the full potential of the work project and my personal ideas.
										My IT interest are based on the role of a Full Stack Developer, and I'm fascinated with the idea of
										automation and machine learning. These are the skills I'm hoping to gain during my Bachelor of IT
										at RMIT.<br>

									 My name is Jayden Watkins and I was born and raised in Central Queensland.
									 My main hobbies are music (listening and playing guitar/bass guitar), photography
									 (landscape, portrait, macro), building Bandai Gundam toy robots and everything Japanese
									 (food, language, travelling). My interests in IT stem from growing up in a rural
									 town having to entertain myself, starting out in video games from as early as I can
									 remember to eventually taking every IT elective in high school and building computers
									 for fun. I've dabbled in coding in the past but haven't stuck with it long enough to
									 learn unfortunately. This is one of the main reasons I enrolled in RMIT to keep me
									 focused on something I love and enjoy, and hopefully in the future I can graduate
									 and begin a life-long career in the IT field.

									 It's my pleasure to introduce myself as Mina Roh. I migrated to Australia 14 years ago
									 from South Korea and I currently live in Melbourne, Victoria. I am a working mother of two young
									 girls. I enjoy paper crafts, playing the piano and listening to music. I am interested in all
									 areas of design. The inspiration to study IT came from studying big tech companies such as Apple,
									 Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla and Google to invest in US stocks. I became fascinated with their growth
									 and contributions to the creation of computer-generated value and prosperous technology. My particular
									 interest is cloud computing and cyber security, and I want to pursue a career in that field when
									 I graduate. At the moment, I have basic skills in HTML and CSS, but I would like to improve my
									 computer skills as well as my programming skills after completing my course.

										I am Ben Gabriel Barrios. I was born in Quezon City, Philippines.
										I arrived in Brisbane, Australia on the 12th of September 2021. I love pets and I've fostered a chicken,
										two fish and two cats back in Philippines. My favourite pet is cat. At the age of 4, my father died
										and even though I did not have my real father, my uncles and grandfather took care of me when
										my mother left for Israel so she can support us financially. My first time seeing a computer
										was when I was 8 years old in the care of my uncle who was an IT professor in a Cagayan State University
										in Sanchez Mira, Cagayan, Philippines. That is the first time I was amazed by a device that can
										do so much. My first love was the game Zuma by PopCap Games. My love for games gave me the interest
										to pursue IT program and I hope RMIT can help me. Currently, I have basic skills in HTML and CSS
										and would like to improve to achieve my dream of becoming a Web 3 Developer.<br>

						<h2>IT Project</h2>
						 	<h3>Overview</h3>
								<h4>Topic</h4>

								<p>
								uDecide will be an extraordinary mobile and web-based application for sorting through entertainment from all streaming services the 
								user is subscribed to so that they can easily find something worthwhile to watch. The user will be able to interact with the site on 
								both their mobile devices and browser so that they are not restricted in accessing uDecide whatever platform they prefer to use. 
								There will also be features for customizing what entertainment is shown on your browser or mobile device through manual filters that 
								cover an array of different sections and categories. The user interface will aim to give essential data on the surface to minimize 
								the need for constantly clicking through different pages and taking up more time than should be necessary for finding a movie or 
								show to watch. Every movie and show on uDecide will also have an extremely useful feature which uses data from the largest rating 
								and review websites like IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes to provide the user with an obvious way to tell whether their chosen entertainment 
								is considered good or bad by the majority of watchers, which reduces the risk of the user having to sit through a movie and only find 
								out it has bad writing, plot or acting after they finish watching it. 
								</p>

								<p>
								Inside uDecide's catalogue will be movies and shows from every major streaming service in Australia which each have multiple points 
								of information. One of the greatest ways uDecide helps you pick what you want to watch is through the people who have reviewed and 
								or rated your chosen entertainment through IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes API's. There is also however greater information for quickly 
								deciding on whether a movie or show is worth your time, such as likes and dislikes from fellow uDecide members and trailers that 
								can be watched in app. uDecide also solves a big problem that comes with entertainment listings for kids. Multiple sections will be 
								separated by age range which is a fantastic way to not just make the kids section usable for teenagers but also keep it friendly for 
								younger kids who are not at an age to be left alone with the teenage content usually found in general kid's sections. 
								</p>

								<h4>Motivation</h4>

								<p>
								The motivation behind uDecide stems from multiple problems with today's streaming service landscape. With such a large number of 
								streaming services out there it is a frustrating time waster to have to keep switching between different applications with vastly 
								different UI's, categories, filters, and search options. There is also little reliable information given about a certain movie or 
								show on a streaming services platform which creates the need to find valuable information such as filters and reviews yourself. This 
								tedious process makes the time it takes to find something you want to watch expand well beyond what is appropriate and starts 
								ruining the experience a streaming service is meant to give you. This tedious process is the motivation behind uDecide, the annoying 
								waste of time and effort just to find a simple movie or show is gone and now you have all your entertainment in one place with a way 
								to search, filter and view ratings that trumps any streaming services ability to do so. 
								</p>

								<h4>Landscape</h4>

								<p>
								Similar products such as ‘Flickmetrix’ are available let you browse all movies and help filter what your preferred movie might 
								be, ‘Rotten Tomatoes’ is another entertainment scoring system that represents the percentage of critic reviews on a certain tv 
								show or movie. Even streaming services such as netflix offer a similar method of recommendation to a user where there is a user 
								recommended rating on the movies home page. The products mentioned above all compete in the entertainment rating industry in 
								their own unique ways however what remains special about Udecide is the integration of many different  streaming services and 
								entertainment rating systems such as IMDb, Netflix and Rotten Tomatoes which is used in an application/website form to give a 
								very detailed recommendation of user’s entertainment preferences.  
								</p>

							<h3>Description</h3>
								<h4>Aims</h4>

								<p>
								The aim of this project is to provide meaningful entertainment for viewers who use the TV guide of watching TV shows or movies through recommendations 
								from uDecide. uDecide provides users with the information they need on any streaming services catalogue to decide on what they want to watch in a timely 
								manner. Viewers can use uDecide with any Australian streaming service. uDecide's goal is to give viewers a high-quality TV streaming experience, which 
								will be realized through easy access to information not found on streaming services. uDecide will guide the optimal service through various manual 
								filters, categories and reviews recommended by other sites and analyze the audiovisual data of past they have seen. 
								</p>

								<p>
								<b>API’s</b><br>
								<br>
								For uDecide’s rating and reviews section to function there will need to be multiple API’s for IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes and possibly others that request the 
								required data to be displayed on the front end of the site. The API usage needs to be determined to limit the amount of requests to the bare minimum so 
								that there is no cost of requesting ratings and review data. Due to the ratings and reviews coming from multiple API’s there may be unequal usage to fit 
								what we can use from each separate API.  
								</p>

								<h4>Plans and Progress</h4>
								<h4>Roles</h4>
								<h4>Scope and Limits</h4>

								<p>
								The scope of uDecide is currently limited to the most realistically implementable features with our current time and skill set. The first deliverable 
								will be a skeleton project that contains the planned UI (User Interface) and a mock movie catalogue created using Figma. Figma will allow for a large 
								focus to be put into the UI of uDecide which is extremely important due to the necessity to display information in a quickly interpretable format for the 
								users such as ratings, reviews, title, etc. The reason a clean and informational UI is so important is to cut down the need to click forward and back 
								through pages which can cause built up time spent just waiting for a site page to load. The next and one of the most important deliverables is a basic 
								HTML/CSS website inspired by the Figma skeleton that is hosted on GitHub pages which allows for online access. This site will contain a large enough 
								number of movies and shows that uDecide's features can be displayed on a scale that will give someone an idea of what the finished product will be like. 
								The star feature of this simple version one of uDecide is its usage of API's for displaying ratings and reviews for the user to consider when deciding on 
								what to watch.
								</p>

								<p>
								With the time constraints and the currently limited skills of our team there are many features that will not be implemented in uDecide’s version one 
								showcase. The first of these is the machine learning algorithm that uses user data gathered through their site usage to generate recommendations that are 
								accurate most of the time. Next is web scraping content from all the streaming services catalogues we wish to list on uDecide, which would also affect the 
								API usage as some APIs (application program interfaces) have a cost to use over a certain amount of times causing the API to be near useless with little 
								information being able to be displayed not considering multiple users. Finally, the manual filters section will also be unachievable since most of our time 
								needs to be put into the core features of uDecide and jamming in more than the bare minimum will result in a lower quality product. 
								</p>
								
								<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>

								<p>
									<b>Figma - <a href="https://www.figma.com/">https://www.figma.com/</a></b><br>
									<br>
									Figma is going to be heavily used for uDecide's design requirements. With Figma we can experiment greatly with both the UI side of things and the UX side 
									of things by creating mockups of uDecide in Figma. Jayden Watkins has experience in Figma both from his own experimentation and from his friend who is a 
									professional UX designer and uses Figma frequently.<br>
									<br>
									<b>VSCode - Version 1.67</b><br>
									<br>
									We will use VSCode as the primary text editor that is used for developing uDecide. The VSCode text editor is highly versatile and useful for a multitude 
									of programming subjects which will allow for a great deal of efficiency when developing uDecide. Philip has experience using VSCode for several 
									programming projects in the past half year.<br>
									<br>
									<b>HTML5</b><br>
									<br>
									Every member of JustDoIT has experience using HTMl5 for multiple projects. We have all successfully created individual HTML5 websites that display 
									information about ourselves in both text and image form. Our group members also have further experience in our group assessment where we successfully 
									used our HTML skills to edit and put further content onto our website template. 
									<b>CSS3</b><br>
									<br>
									All of JustDoIT's group members also have some experience using CSS3. Some members have begun using CSS3 in their individual HTML5 projects to add simple 
									styling and colors to their web page. Other members have gained experience in CSS3 through the JustDoIT group website which involves using CSS3 with the 
									HTML5 webpage so that the HTML5 elements are appropriately styled. 
									<b>JavaScript ES6</b><br>
									<br>
									Alongside HTML5 and CSS3 is JavaScript which will be necessary for developing all complex features on the uDecide website such as manual filters and some 
									UX functionality. Most importantly however, JavaScript will be used for API implementation into uDecide. Philip has basic experience using JavaScript 
									which he has gained through online learning and experimentation. 
									<b>Git 2.36.0</b><br>
									<br>
									Source control will be employed through Git as it is an essential tool for keeping backups and track of changes in uDecide's code so that any bugs that 
									may arise can be traced back and in case of large enough bugs Git will allow for uDecide to be reverted to a previous version while the bug in question 
									is fixed. All members of uDecide have some experience with using Git for both their individual and group products. 
									<b>GitHub - <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a></b><br>
									<br>
									Git will be used in tandem with GitHub for uDecide's source control. JustDoIT will be able to work on uDecide simultaneously online using GitHub for 
									hosting uDecide's Git repository online. GitHub will also be used for hosting uDecide with GitHub pages hosting for static sites. Every member of uDecide 
									has experience and is able to make skillful use of GitHub for source control and online webpage hosting.
