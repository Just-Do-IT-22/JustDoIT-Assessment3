									  My name is Fazil Syed and I'm in team Just Do IT. I was born in Hyderabad, India
										and raised in Melbourne, Victoria where I currently reside with my beautiful wife and two young
										boys. My hobbies are cooking, fishing, traveling, watching movies/TV shows and DJing. I can speak
										both Hindi and Urdu. My interest in IT started at a very early age in the early 90's, and although
										I did do some IT studies approximately 20 years ago, I decided to follow a different career path. My
										interest in IT reignited recently whilst working on some IT related work projects and my own
										personal IT ideas. I felt helpless as I lacked the advanced tools, skills, and knowledge to achieve
										the desired outcome and expanding on the full potential of the work project and my personal ideas.
										My IT interest are based on the role of a Full Stack Developer, and I'm fascinated with the idea of
										automation and machine learning. These are the skills I'm hoping to gain during my Bachelor of IT
										at RMIT.<br>

										My name is Philip Porte. I was born and currently live in Sydney NSW. My Mum and Dad's family come
										separately from Italy and Germany. I have completed Year 10 of high school and have done some other
										learning about IT by myself. My hobbies mainly include playing video games and using my computer for
										things like programming and other entertainment. When it comes to IT, I love being able to program
										my own applications and websites. Right now the extent of my experience is basic HTML and CSS. But
										I am learning about other topics in programming that interest me such as Python and JavaScript. I also
										aim to learn many other IT skills overtime that interest me and will help me get the job I want.

									 My name is Jayden Watkins and I was born and raised in Central Queensland.
									 My main hobbies are music (listening and playing guitar/bass guitar), photography
									 (landscape, portrait, macro), building Bandai Gundam toy robots and everything Japanese
									 (food, language, travelling). My interests in IT stem from growing up in a rural
									 town having to entertain myself, starting out in video games from as early as I can
									 remember to eventually taking every IT elective in high school and building computers
									 for fun. I've dabbled in coding in the past but haven't stuck with it long enough to
									 learn unfortunately. This is one of the main reasons I enrolled in RMIT to keep me
									 focused on something I love and enjoy, and hopefully in the future I can graduate
									 and begin a life-long career in the IT field.

									 It's my pleasure to introduce myself as Mina Roh. I migrated to Australia 14 years ago
									 from South Korea and I currently live in Melbourne, Victoria. I am a working mother of two young
									 girls. I enjoy paper crafts, playing the piano and listening to music. I am interested in all
									 areas of design. The inspiration to study IT came from studying big tech companies such as Apple,
									 Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla and Google to invest in US stocks. I became fascinated with their growth
									 and contributions to the creation of computer-generated value and prosperous technology. My particular
									 interest is cloud computing and cyber security, and I want to pursue a career in that field when
									 I graduate. At the moment, I have basic skills in HTML and CSS, but I would like to improve my
									 computer skills as well as my programming skills after completing my course.

									<p>
										I am Ben Gabriel Barrios. I was born in Quezon City, Philippines.
										I arrived in Brisbane, Australia on the 12th of September 2021. I love pets and I've fostered a chicken,
										two fish and two cats back in Philippines. My favourite pet is cat. At the age of 4, my father died
										and even though I did not have my real father, my uncles and grandfather took care of me when
										my mother left for Israel so she can support us financially. My first time seeing a computer
										was when I was 8 years old in the care of my uncle who was an IT professor in a Cagayan State University
										in Sanchez Mira, Cagayan, Philippines. That is the first time I was amazed by a device that can
										do so much. My first love was the game Zuma by PopCap Games. My love for games gave me the interest
										to pursue IT program and I hope RMIT can help me. Currently, I have basic skills in HTML and CSS
										and would like to improve to achieve my dream of becoming a Web 3 Developer.<br>
