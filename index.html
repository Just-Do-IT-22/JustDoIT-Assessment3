									  My name is Fazil Syed and I'm in team Just Do IT. I was born in Hyderabad, India
										and raised in Melbourne, Victoria where I currently reside with my beautiful wife and two young
										boys. My hobbies are cooking, fishing, traveling, watching movies/TV shows and DJing. I can speak
										both Hindi and Urdu. My interest in IT started at a very early age in the early 90's, and although
										I did do some IT studies approximately 20 years ago, I decided to follow a different career path. My
										interest in IT reignited recently whilst working on some IT related work projects and my own
										personal IT ideas. I felt helpless as I lacked the advanced tools, skills, and knowledge to achieve
										the desired outcome and expanding on the full potential of the work project and my personal ideas.
										My IT interest are based on the role of a Full Stack Developer, and I'm fascinated with the idea of
										automation and machine learning. These are the skills I'm hoping to gain during my Bachelor of IT
										at RMIT.<br>

							<h2>Group Processes</h2>

							<h3>Fazil</h3>
							<b>How well did your group work together in assessment 2?</b><br>
							<p>
								As a group, we worked exceptionally well together considering it was an auto allocated group. I believe the reason behind this success is due to the following:
							</p>
								<ul>
									<li>We all respected each other and our opinion.</li>
									<li>We were all very supportive in our group discussions and with ideas put forward.</li>
									<li>We share a common goal, that is, to obtain the highest possible grades in our assignment.</li>
									<li>We all had allocated tasks to complete and understood what needed to be done.</li>
									<li>There were no disagreements within the team.</li>
								</ul>

							<b>Will your work processes be changing for assessment 3?</b>
							<p>
								Although our work process towards A2 provided the best possible outcome, there’s still room for improvements which we have jointly agreed that can put us in
								a better position with regards to A3. These are minor process changes that includes structuring our team meetings better with clear agendas, aim to complete
								our A3 in advance so that we’re not rushing as we did on A2 and to communicate more proactively on MS Teams chat.
							</p>

							<h3>Philip</h3>
							<b>How well did your group work together in assessment 2?</b><br>
							<p>
								Our team worked incredibly well together from the start of the assessment to the very finish. We started off slowly since we were auto assigned and were not
								familiar with each other beforehand. This was only a problem until our first meeting as we immediately became friendly and started making jokes. This
								friendliness enabled us to work together fluently and openly, which increased our communication and overall work quality.
							</p>

							<b>Will your work processes be changing for assessment 3?</b>
							<p>
								I don't feel any changes are necessary in our workflow aside from having shorter meetings. Our strategies and workflow have served us well so far even under
								tight time constraints. I believe that since we are starting assessment three off with a familiar environment from assessment two, we will not have a slow
								start and instead be able to work efficiently from the start.
							</p>

							<h3>Jayden</h3>
							<b>How well did your group work together in assessment 2?</b><br>
							<p>
								Overall, I feel our team worked well on the project in its entirety. Our project was fully fleshed out and each team member’s individual contributions were
								the reason for that. Even though we were randomly assigned, after our first meeting we were all much more comfortable together and carried that momentum into
								working on the project. Everyone was consistently present at the online meetings with only a few absences (myself included) and conversation was frequent in
								the MS Teams chat.
							</p>

							<b>Will your work processes be changing for assessment 3?</b>
							<p>
								Our process will remain the same for A3 with a few minor changes including:
								<ul>
									<li>More frequent updates through chat; using our meeting times less for updates and slimming the time needed for them down.</li>
									<li>Immediately starting repositories for GitHub and better maintaining of our shared word doc for individual efforts so that we can show activity log more accurately everyone’s contributions. </li>
									<li>Requesting more feedback from lecturers earlier on to clarify issues earlier and spend less time trying to figure out what is required for us. </li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<h3>Mina</h3>
							<b>How well did your group work together in assessment 2?</b><br>
							<p>
								Our group was automatically assigned, but each team member took their own responsibilities and completed the assessment task with integrity. We could
								effectively finish assessment 2 with our creative thoughts and cooperative attitude. In this task as well, I expect that each of us will perform well in the
								division of work through various collaborations and role distribution.
							</p>

							<b>Will your work processes be changing for assessment 3?</b>
							<ul>
								<li>We plan to shorten our meeting times and make more use of chat and school emails for effective communication. </li>
								<li>Previously, after we finished writing work and did Github at the last stage. We ran out of time and rushed a lot. In this assessment, I expect to use the Github repository in the early stage. </li>
							</ul>

							<h3>Ben</h3>
							<b>How well did your group work together in assessment 2?</b><br>
							<p>
								In assessment 2 the group did work together well. Even though we are auto allocated in the group we did well in communication and given the fact that we 
								did not converse before we were allocated the group and from different classes. We are like longtime friends after breaking the ice. I am happy that the 
								team accepted each other's differences. Each of us took part in the assessment. 
							</p>

							<b>Will your work processes be changing for assessment 3?</b>
							<p>
								Active use of tools and introducing more tools for improvement. 
							</p>

							<h3>Cristian</h3>
							<b>How well did your group work together in assessment 2?</b><br>
							<p>
								In assignment 2, I felt like our team worked well considering we were automatically allocated and a week behind. I felt like we organised ourselves well 
								which was one of our strong points. There was plenty of communication throughout the team meeting and effective allocation of tasks. 
							</p>

							<b>Will your work processes be changing for assessment 3?</b>
							<p>
								We will be introducing a more structured team meeting schedule and collaborating more on certain parts of the assessment to achieve more consistency 
								through the project outline.

													pursuing a career in software development and this shared goal of becoming software developers will bring us
													through many similar stages of getting to that goal. There are also multiple skills that my teammates and I must
													have in common to become proficient in our ideal jobs. Some of these skills are related to programming, like
													being able to problem solve and debug effectively, other skills are more general like being able to work in a
													team and communicate well when working on large scale projects.

													application, game or website development which is done layers above operating systems programming. There is also
													a difference in the category which our platform for software development falls into. Game development could be

				<!-- Tools -->
				<section id="four" class="wrapper style3 fade-up">
					<div class="inner">
						<h2>Tools</h2>
						<p>
							<br>
							For the project as the methods used for the previous project, several tools were used to successfully complete the project. The most
							used tool was Microsoft Team, and it was used for smooth communication and planning among group members. The Microsoft team has helped
							us communicate without having to physically meet, no matter what distance we live. We regularly invited each team member and held
							meetings at least twice a week, in which we had time to present our collaborating work. And we used the platform to share and edit useful
							documents and necessary information. If there were members who missed the meeting, it is available to review the contents once again through
							our group meeting recordings and transcripts. And for clearer communication, we also used chatting to share necessary content and areas to be
							updated. The Microsoft team was a great communication tool for us, and we were able to share and communicate with each other wherever we were
							and at any time we wanted. We also used the Student Outlook E-mail as another communication tool to contact personally or to share information we need.
						</p>
						<p>
							<br>
							The other crucial tool used for the group project was Github and after adding the repository for the work to ultimately generate the website,
							it was hosted on Github pages. It was agreed to use the same website used in the previous project, and HTML/CSS templates were used to structure the
							website for the website creation, and the information and necessary contents for the requirements were added and formatted to the group project. For
							completing the website, the applicable Github page details are constructed to host the source code and present the project website.
           				</p>
            			<h2>Audit Trail</h2>
					 	<p>
						  	The tool that best reflects our collaborative process is Microsoft teams, and we conducted various collaborations through this platform. The Github repository
							isn't the best tool for reflecting our group projects. As before, we did our best to finish the written work first, and Github was used in the last stage.
							And there were team members who could quickly and accurately reflect on the repository, allowing other team members to focus more on other areas they are good at.

						<h2>IT Project</h2>
						 	<h3>Overview</h3>
								<h4>Topic</h4>

								<p>
								uDecide will be an extraordinary mobile and web-based application for sorting through entertainment from all streaming services the
								user is subscribed to so that they can easily find something worthwhile to watch. The user will be able to interact with the site on
								both their mobile devices and browser so that they are not restricted in accessing uDecide whatever platform they prefer to use.
								There will also be features for customizing what entertainment is shown on your browser or mobile device through manual filters that
								cover an array of different sections and categories. The user interface will aim to give essential data on the surface to minimize
								the need for constantly clicking through different pages and taking up more time than should be necessary for finding a movie or
								show to watch. Every movie and show on uDecide will also have an extremely useful feature which uses data from the largest rating
								and review websites like IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes to provide the user with an obvious way to tell whether their chosen entertainment
								is considered good or bad by the majority of watchers, which reduces the risk of the user having to sit through a movie and only find
								out it has bad writing, plot or acting after they finish watching it.
								</p>

								<p>
								Inside uDecide's catalogue will be movies and shows from every major streaming service in Australia which each have multiple points
								of information. One of the greatest ways uDecide helps you pick what you want to watch is through the people who have reviewed and
								or rated your chosen entertainment through IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes API's. There is also however greater information for quickly
								deciding on whether a movie or show is worth your time, such as likes and dislikes from fellow uDecide members and trailers that
								can be watched in app. uDecide also solves a big problem that comes with entertainment listings for kids. Multiple sections will be
								separated by age range which is a fantastic way to not just make the kids section usable for teenagers but also keep it friendly for
								younger kids who are not at an age to be left alone with the teenage content usually found in general kid's sections.
								</p>

								<h4>Motivation</h4>

								<p>
								The motivation behind uDecide stems from multiple problems with today's streaming service landscape. With such a large number of
								streaming services out there it is a frustrating time waster to have to keep switching between different applications with vastly
								different UI's, categories, filters, and search options. There is also little reliable information given about a certain movie or
								show on a streaming services platform which creates the need to find valuable information such as filters and reviews yourself. This
								tedious process makes the time it takes to find something you want to watch expand well beyond what is appropriate and starts
								ruining the experience a streaming service is meant to give you. This tedious process is the motivation behind uDecide, the annoying
								waste of time and effort just to find a simple movie or show is gone and now you have all your entertainment in one place with a way
								to search, filter and view ratings that trumps any streaming services ability to do so.
								</p>

								<h4>Landscape</h4>

								<p>
								Similar products such as ‘Flickmetrix’ are available let you browse all movies and help filter what your preferred movie might
								be, ‘Rotten Tomatoes’ is another entertainment scoring system that represents the percentage of critic reviews on a certain tv
								show or movie. Streaming services such as netflix offer a similar method of recommendation to a user where there is a user
								recommended rating on the movies home page. The products mentioned above all compete in the entertainment rating industry in
								their own unique ways however what remains special about Udecide is the integration of many different  streaming services and
								entertainment rating systems such as IMDb, Netflix and Rotten Tomatoes which is used in an application/website form to give a
								very detailed recommendation of user’s entertainment preferences.
								</p>

							<h3>Description</h3>
								<h4>Aims</h4>

								<p>
								The aim of this project is to provide meaningful entertainment for viewers who use the TV guide of watching TV shows or movies through recommendations
								from uDecide. uDecide provides users with the information they need on any streaming services catalogue to decide on what they want to watch in a timely
								manner. Viewers can use uDecide with any Australian streaming service. uDecide's goal is to give viewers a high-quality TV streaming experience, which
								will be realized through easy access to information not found on streaming services. uDecide will guide the optimal service through various manual
								filters, categories and reviews recommended by other sites and analyze the audiovisual data of past they have seen.
								<br>
								<br>
								For uDecide’s rating and reviews section to function there will need to be multiple API’s for IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes and possibly others that request the
								required data to be displayed on the front end of the site. The API usage needs to be determined to limit the amount of requests to the bare minimum so
								that there is no cost of requesting ratings and review data. Due to the ratings and reviews coming from multiple API’s there may be unequal usage to fit
								what we can use from each separate API.

								<h4>Roles</h4>
								<b>Performance Marketing Manager</b>
								<br>
								<p>
									The role of the marketing manager is important to the success of the TV guide project. This role will perform significant tasks of connecting the 
									latest releases and popular movies or TV shows provided by various streaming companies such as Netflix, Disney Plus, and Amazon Prime TV. In addition, 
									it is necessary to understand the demand of users through market research and to collect meaningful data to provide high-quality content that can be 
									realized to customers. For this role, communication skills for interacting with other companies are essential, and market research skills are helpful. 
									In addition, it is necessary to understand the tools are related in this industry such as Google Ads, GDN, Facebook Business Manager and DV 360. It 
									is also required to have experience with BI tools like PowerBi or Google Datastudio. (Jobs.lever.co, 2022) 
								</p>

								<b>Software Engineer-Tooling & Core infrastructure</b>
								<br>
								<p>
									In u Decide, a software engineer will build and design the software and form a system to provide a variety of contents by building tools to deliver 
									code to users all over the world. It is necessary to keep track of the core web vitals to improve the performance of u Decide. (Join.com, 2022) The 
									software engineer will perform to migrate data from its own hosting to the cloud, which helps the server reliability and serves users quickly. As 
									cloud services offer a portfolio of hundreds of recyclable services, like Lego blocks, so they can use a combination of cloud services with a variety 
									of service functions, including video conversion, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI) recommendation engines. The design of a web 
									router is needed as a "user-face-to-face" component to reduce the loading time of the site. The stacks required for u Decide will be realized in the 
									cloud, and this role will play an essential role in shaping and advancing this technology stack. (Join.com, 2022) 
								</p>

								<b>Senior Web User Interface Engineer</b>
								<br>
								<p>
									Web user interface engineers are necessary for this project to provide convenience for users by doing interaction with all relevant web pages and 
									screens while utilizing an app or a website. These engineers should have knowledge and skills dealing with HTML, CSS, HTTP, and JavaScript. It is 
									required to have front-end development experience. (UserTesting. 2022) 
								</p>

								<b>Senior Web User Interface Designer</b>
								<br>
								<p>
									UI Designers are necessary to design and create the user interface that is necessary from the user's point of view. It will play a key role in building 
									and designing the visual elements needed to use the Web and make the website effective and easy to use. It involves organizing information throughout 
									the website, and building prototypes that UI designers can use to activate the experience with aesthetic prosperity. (The Jotform Blog. 2022) 
								</p>

								<b>A Senior System Administrator</b>
								<p>
									Senior system administrators are required to professionally supervise the necessary system operations in u Decide. The tasks required are to monitor 
									the performance of hardware and software, configure the system, install the server, and check that the related technical aspects are operating smoothly. 
									They can try to maximize the efficiency of the IT infrastructure and ensures security.(Zippia.com. 2022) 
								</p>

								<h4>Scope and Limits</h4>

								<p>
								The scope of uDecide is currently limited to the most realistically implementable features with our current time and skill set. The first deliverable
								will be a skeleton project that contains the planned UI (User Interface) and a mock movie catalogue created using Figma. Figma will allow for a large
								focus to be put into the UI of uDecide which is extremely important due to the necessity to display information in a quickly interpretable format for the
								users such as ratings, reviews, title, etc. The reason a clean and informational UI is so important is to cut down the need to click forward and back
								through pages which can cause built up time spent just waiting for a site page to load. The next and one of the most important deliverables is a basic
								HTML/CSS website inspired by the Figma skeleton that is hosted on GitHub pages which allows for online access. This site will contain a large enough
								number of movies and shows that uDecide's features can be displayed on a scale that will give someone an idea of what the finished product will be like.
								The star feature of this simple version one of uDecide is its usage of API's for displaying ratings and reviews for the user to consider when deciding on
								what to watch.
								</p>

								<p>
								With the time constraints and the currently limited skills of our team there are many features that will not be implemented in uDecide’s version one
								showcase. The first of these is the machine learning algorithm that uses user data gathered through their site usage to generate recommendations that are
								accurate most of the time. Next is web scraping content from all the streaming services catalogues we wish to list on uDecide, which would also affect the
								API usage as some APIs (application program interfaces) have a cost to use over a certain amount of times causing the API to be near useless with little
								information being able to be displayed not considering multiple users. Finally, the manual filters section will also be unachievable since most of our time
								needs to be put into the core features of uDecide and jamming in more than the bare minimum will result in a lower quality product.

								<h4>Testing</h4>

								<p>
									The project will be heavily alpha tested by in-house developers and experts to ensure to fix obvious bugs and glitches that the application may have. This
									will then get the application ready for a beta testing period of 3-5 weeks by real users to ensure that the application is validated in areas such as
									usability, functionality, compatibility and reliability (testbytes 2019). This will help us understand where we go wrong and where we go right which
									ultimately will help improve our application further and take us one step closer to release. There will be a mixture of people that will be beta testing
									the product such as those who are technical and those who are for marketing purposes. The technical audience will give us constructive feedback and help
									detect bugs that were missed during the alpha testing phase. The marketing audience will be those that have a higher social following to help increase
									awareness of the application leading up to its release (Appteitive 2018).
								</p>

								<h4>Timeframe</h4>

								<h4>Risks</h4>

								<p>
									In relation to uDecide, there are certain potential risks involved when developing the application. First off, the application may just not be valuable
									to the users which can be due to the lack of research in the industry or developers ignoring end-users while developing the application.  As end-users
									are ultimately the ones that are going to use the application, it is important that the individuals that are constructing the application are highly aware
									of the task at hand to deliver the most optimal application possible in the end. The application can go all to waste if the application development is
									approached from the wrong perspective causing eventually leading to no one using the app.<br>
									<br>
									Another risk can be poor UI/UX integration which is very important in the development of uDecide. It is crucial that uDecide has a user-friendly interface
									with great user experience to have the application be of value to their daily needs. If not done properly there is a great risk of customer loss and
									reputation damage once the application is released for all end-users (Creative Tim 2021).<br>
									<br>
									Security breaches are another risk when developing uDecide. It is important for developers to take the appropriate security measures to create a safe
									end-user experience and prevent things such as personal data being leaked or other confidential information. If not done correctly there will be potential
									security risks that will damage the application’s reputation and end-user experience which will ultimately hurt the uDecide business (mrc 2013). <br>
									<br>
									There is a potential risk if uDecide is designed for many platforms at the same time. This can be costly and time consuming especially as uDecide is a
									smaller business. The uDecide team must come to a decision on what platform to develop the application for at the beginning to save time and costs on
									advertising and development (Creative Tim 2021).
								</p>

								<h4>Group processes and communications</h4>
								<p>
									We believe that communication is vital in a group. In this age there are a lot of ways to communicate it may confuse you to use a lot of means so in
									communication we are using just Microsoft Teams and Outlook as means to connect us. Fazil creates emails to remind us of the time and day of videocall
									meeting using Outlook for reminders and Microsoft Teams for videocall. We are arranging a two a week video call meeting so we can catch up to each
									responsibility, but Jayden said that we must also use the chat system in Microsoft Teams for simultaneous work.<br>
									<br>
									In production the process dictates how long and how fast the product will be produced. If you have systematic processes, you will expect production to be
									faster so processing in a group is important for us. In these assessments we did the 5 Process group which are Initiating Processes, Planning Process,
									Executing Process, Controlling Process and Closing Process. We initiated the assessment by introducing ourselves to the requirements for the assessment
									by reading the pdf given to us. The plan is each volunteered on which part of the assessment they are confident in doing. We believe the execution went
									well considering all of us volunteered. At every meeting we are reminded of the responsibilities we have taken on and through chat also. As we end our
									assessment, we are doing feedback for us to improve for the future projects.
