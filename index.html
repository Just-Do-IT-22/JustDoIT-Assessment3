									  My name is Fazil Syed and I'm in team Just Do IT. I was born in Hyderabad, India
										and raised in Melbourne, Victoria where I currently reside with my beautiful wife and two young
										boys. My hobbies are cooking, fishing, traveling, watching movies/TV shows and DJing. I can speak
										both Hindi and Urdu. My interest in IT started at a very early age in the early 90's, and although
										I did do some IT studies approximately 20 years ago, I decided to follow a different career path. My
										interest in IT reignited recently whilst working on some IT related work projects and my own
										personal IT ideas. I felt helpless as I lacked the advanced tools, skills, and knowledge to achieve
										the desired outcome and expanding on the full potential of the work project and my personal ideas.
										My IT interest are based on the role of a Full Stack Developer, and I'm fascinated with the idea of
										automation and machine learning. These are the skills I'm hoping to gain during my Bachelor of IT
										at RMIT.<br>

									 My name is Jayden Watkins and I was born and raised in Central Queensland.
									 My main hobbies are music (listening and playing guitar/bass guitar), photography
									 (landscape, portrait, macro), building Bandai Gundam toy robots and everything Japanese
									 (food, language, travelling). My interests in IT stem from growing up in a rural
									 town having to entertain myself, starting out in video games from as early as I can
									 remember to eventually taking every IT elective in high school and building computers
									 for fun. I've dabbled in coding in the past but haven't stuck with it long enough to
									 learn unfortunately. This is one of the main reasons I enrolled in RMIT to keep me
									 focused on something I love and enjoy, and hopefully in the future I can graduate
									 and begin a life-long career in the IT field.

									 It's my pleasure to introduce myself as Mina Roh. I migrated to Australia 14 years ago
									 from South Korea and I currently live in Melbourne, Victoria. I am a working mother of two young

									 areas of design. The inspiration to study IT came from studying big tech companies such as Apple,
									 Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla and Google to invest in US stocks. I became fascinated with their growth
									 and contributions to the creation of computer-generated value and prosperous technology. My particular
									 interest is cloud computing and cyber security, and I want to pursue a career in that field when
									 I graduate. At the moment, I have basic skills in HTML and CSS, but I would like to improve my
									 computer skills as well as my programming skills after completing my course.

										was when I was 8 years old in the care of my uncle who was an IT professor in a Cagayan State University
										in Sanchez Mira, Cagayan, Philippines. That is the first time I was amazed by a device that can
										do so much. My first love was the game Zuma by PopCap Games. My love for games gave me the interest
										to pursue IT program and I hope RMIT can help me. Currently, I have basic skills in HTML and CSS
										and would like to improve to achieve my dream of becoming a Web 3 Developer.<br>

							<h2>Group Processes</h2>

							<h3>Fazil</h3>
							<b>How well did your group work together in assessment 2?</b><br>
							<p>
								As a group, we worked exceptionally well together considering it was an auto allocated group. I believe the reason behind this success is due to the following:
							</p>
								<ul>
									<li>We all respected each other and our opinion.</li>
									<li>We were all very supportive in our group discussions and with ideas put forward.</li>
									<li>We share a common goal, that is, to obtain the highest possible grades in our assignment.</li>
									<li>We all had allocated tasks to complete and understood what needed to be done.</li>
									<li>There were no disagreements within the team.</li>
								</ul>

							<b>Will your work processes be changing for assessment 3?</b>
							<p>
								Although our work process towards A2 provided the best possible outcome, there’s still room for improvements which we have jointly agreed that can put us in 
								a better position with regards to A3. These are minor process changes that includes structuring our team meetings better with clear agendas, aim to complete 
								our A3 in advance so that we’re not rushing as we did on A2 and to communicate more proactively on MS Teams chat. 
							</p>

							<h3>Philip</h3>
							<b>How well did your group work together in assessment 2?</b><br>
							<p>
								Our team worked incredibly well together from the start of the assessment to the very finish. We started off slowly since we were auto assigned and were not 
								familiar with each other beforehand. This was only a problem until our first meeting as we immediately became friendly and started making jokes. This 
								friendliness enabled us to work together fluently and openly, which increased our communication and overall work quality. 
							</p>

							<b>Will your work processes be changing for assessment 3?</b>
							<p>
								I don't feel any changes are necessary in our workflow aside from having shorter meetings. Our strategies and workflow have served us well so far even under 
								tight time constraints. I believe that since we are starting assessment three off with a familiar environment from assessment two, we will not have a slow 
								start and instead be able to work efficiently from the start. 
							</p>

							<h3>Jayden</h3>
							<b>How well did your group work together in assessment 2?</b><br>
							<p>
								Overall, I feel our team worked well on the project in its entirety. Our project was fully fleshed out and each team member’s individual contributions were 
								the reason for that. Even though we were randomly assigned, after our first meeting we were all much more comfortable together and carried that momentum into 
								working on the project. Everyone was consistently present at the online meetings with only a few absences (myself included) and conversation was frequent in 
								the MS Teams chat.  
							</p>

							<b>Will your work processes be changing for assessment 3?</b>
							<p>
								Our process will remain the same for A3 with a few minor changes including:
								<ul>
									<li>More frequent updates through chat; using our meeting times less for updates and slimming the time needed for them down.</li>
									<li>Immediately starting repositories for GitHub and better maintaining of our shared word doc for individual efforts so that we can show activity log more accurately everyone’s contributions. </li>
									<li>Requesting more feedback from lecturers earlier on to clarify issues earlier and spend less time trying to figure out what is required for us. </li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<h3>Mina</h3>
							<b>How well did your group work together in assessment 2?</b><br>
							<p>
								Our group was automatically assigned, but each team member took their own responsibilities and completed the assessment task with integrity. We could 
								effectively finish assessment 2 with our creative thoughts and cooperative attitude. In this task as well, I expect that each of us will perform well in the 
								division of work through various collaborations and role distribution. 
							</p>

							<b>Will your work processes be changing for assessment 3?</b>
							<ul>
								<li>We plan to shorten our meeting times and make more use of chat and school emails for effective communication. </li>
								<li>Previously, after we finished writing work and did Github at the last stage. We ran out of time and rushed a lot. In this assessment, I expect to use the Github repository in the early stage. </li>
							</ul>

							<h3>Ben</h3>
							<b>How well did your group work together in assessment 2?</b><br>
							<b>Will your work processes be changing for assessment 3?</b>

							<h3>Cristian</h3>
							<b>How well did your group work together in assessment 2?</b><br>
							<b>Will your work processes be changing for assessment 3?</b>
							<p>In assignment 2 team Just Do IT worked well together. There was effective communication in team meetings and good allocation of tasks. We will be introducing a 
								more structured team meeting schedule and collaborating more on certain parts of the assessment to achieve more consistency through the project outline.

						<h2>IT Project</h2>
						 	<h3>Overview</h3>
								<h4>Topic</h4>

								<p>
								uDecide will be an extraordinary mobile and web-based application for sorting through entertainment from all streaming services the 
								user is subscribed to so that they can easily find something worthwhile to watch. The user will be able to interact with the site on 
								both their mobile devices and browser so that they are not restricted in accessing uDecide whatever platform they prefer to use. 
								There will also be features for customizing what entertainment is shown on your browser or mobile device through manual filters that 
								cover an array of different sections and categories. The user interface will aim to give essential data on the surface to minimize 
								the need for constantly clicking through different pages and taking up more time than should be necessary for finding a movie or 
								show to watch. Every movie and show on uDecide will also have an extremely useful feature which uses data from the largest rating 
								and review websites like IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes to provide the user with an obvious way to tell whether their chosen entertainment 
								is considered good or bad by the majority of watchers, which reduces the risk of the user having to sit through a movie and only find 
								out it has bad writing, plot or acting after they finish watching it. 
								</p>

								<p>
								Inside uDecide's catalogue will be movies and shows from every major streaming service in Australia which each have multiple points 
								of information. One of the greatest ways uDecide helps you pick what you want to watch is through the people who have reviewed and 
								or rated your chosen entertainment through IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes API's. There is also however greater information for quickly 
								deciding on whether a movie or show is worth your time, such as likes and dislikes from fellow uDecide members and trailers that 
								can be watched in app. uDecide also solves a big problem that comes with entertainment listings for kids. Multiple sections will be 
								separated by age range which is a fantastic way to not just make the kids section usable for teenagers but also keep it friendly for 
								younger kids who are not at an age to be left alone with the teenage content usually found in general kid's sections. 
								</p>

								<h4>Motivation</h4>

								<p>
								The motivation behind uDecide stems from multiple problems with today's streaming service landscape. With such a large number of 
								streaming services out there it is a frustrating time waster to have to keep switching between different applications with vastly 
								different UI's, categories, filters, and search options. There is also little reliable information given about a certain movie or 
								show on a streaming services platform which creates the need to find valuable information such as filters and reviews yourself. This 
								tedious process makes the time it takes to find something you want to watch expand well beyond what is appropriate and starts 
								ruining the experience a streaming service is meant to give you. This tedious process is the motivation behind uDecide, the annoying 
								waste of time and effort just to find a simple movie or show is gone and now you have all your entertainment in one place with a way 
								to search, filter and view ratings that trumps any streaming services ability to do so. 
								</p>

								<h4>Landscape</h4>

								<p>
								Similar products such as ‘Flickmetrix’ are available let you browse all movies and help filter what your preferred movie might 
								be, ‘Rotten Tomatoes’ is another entertainment scoring system that represents the percentage of critic reviews on a certain tv 
								show or movie. Even streaming services such as netflix offer a similar method of recommendation to a user where there is a user 
								recommended rating on the movies home page. The products mentioned above all compete in the entertainment rating industry in 
								their own unique ways however what remains special about Udecide is the integration of many different  streaming services and 
								entertainment rating systems such as IMDb, Netflix and Rotten Tomatoes which is used in an application/website form to give a 
								very detailed recommendation of user’s entertainment preferences.  
								</p>

							<h3>Description</h3>
								<h4>Aims</h4>

								<p>
								The aim of this project is to provide meaningful entertainment for viewers who use the TV guide of watching TV shows or movies through recommendations 
								from uDecide. uDecide provides users with the information they need on any streaming services catalogue to decide on what they want to watch in a timely 
								manner. Viewers can use uDecide with any Australian streaming service. uDecide's goal is to give viewers a high-quality TV streaming experience, which 
								will be realized through easy access to information not found on streaming services. uDecide will guide the optimal service through various manual 
								filters, categories and reviews recommended by other sites and analyze the audiovisual data of past they have seen. 
								<br>
								<br>
								For uDecide’s rating and reviews section to function there will need to be multiple API’s for IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes and possibly others that request the 
								required data to be displayed on the front end of the site. The API usage needs to be determined to limit the amount of requests to the bare minimum so 
								that there is no cost of requesting ratings and review data. Due to the ratings and reviews coming from multiple API’s there may be unequal usage to fit 
								what we can use from each separate API.  
								</p>

								<h4>Plans and Progress</h4>

								<h4>Roles</h4>

								<!-- Wait for update in document before adding to site -->


								<h4>Scope and Limits</h4>

								<p>
								The scope of uDecide is currently limited to the most realistically implementable features with our current time and skill set. The first deliverable 
								will be a skeleton project that contains the planned UI (User Interface) and a mock movie catalogue created using Figma. Figma will allow for a large 
								focus to be put into the UI of uDecide which is extremely important due to the necessity to display information in a quickly interpretable format for the 
								users such as ratings, reviews, title, etc. The reason a clean and informational UI is so important is to cut down the need to click forward and back 
								through pages which can cause built up time spent just waiting for a site page to load. The next and one of the most important deliverables is a basic 
								HTML/CSS website inspired by the Figma skeleton that is hosted on GitHub pages which allows for online access. This site will contain a large enough 
								number of movies and shows that uDecide's features can be displayed on a scale that will give someone an idea of what the finished product will be like. 
								The star feature of this simple version one of uDecide is its usage of API's for displaying ratings and reviews for the user to consider when deciding on 
								what to watch.
								</p>

								<p>
								With the time constraints and the currently limited skills of our team there are many features that will not be implemented in uDecide’s version one 
								showcase. The first of these is the machine learning algorithm that uses user data gathered through their site usage to generate recommendations that are 
								accurate most of the time. Next is web scraping content from all the streaming services catalogues we wish to list on uDecide, which would also affect the 
								API usage as some APIs (application program interfaces) have a cost to use over a certain amount of times causing the API to be near useless with little 
								information being able to be displayed not considering multiple users. Finally, the manual filters section will also be unachievable since most of our time 
								needs to be put into the core features of uDecide and jamming in more than the bare minimum will result in a lower quality product. 
								</p>
								
								<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>

								<p>
									<b>Figma - <a href="https://www.figma.com/">https://www.figma.com/</a></b><br>
									Figma is going to be heavily used for uDecide's design requirements. With Figma we can experiment greatly with both the UI side of things and the UX side 
									of things by creating mockups of uDecide in Figma. Jayden Watkins has experience in Figma both from his own experimentation and from his friend who is a 
									professional UX designer and uses Figma frequently.<br>
									<br>
									<b>HTML5</b><br>
									Every member of JustDoIT has experience using HTMl5 for multiple projects. We have all successfully created individual HTML5 websites that display 
									information about ourselves in both text and image form. Our group members also have further experience in our group assessment where we successfully 
									used our HTML skills to edit and put further content onto our website template. <br>
									<br>
									<b>CSS3</b><br>
									All of JustDoIT's group members also have some experience using CSS3. Some members have begun using CSS3 in their individual HTML5 projects to add simple 
									styling and colors to their web page. Other members have gained experience in CSS3 through the JustDoIT group website which involves using CSS3 with the 
									HTML5 webpage so that the HTML5 elements are appropriately styled.<br>
									<br>
									<b>JavaScript ES6</b><br>
									Alongside HTML5 and CSS3 is JavaScript which will be necessary for developing all complex features on the uDecide website such as manual filters and some 
									UX functionality. Most importantly however, JavaScript will be used for API implementation into uDecide. Philip has basic experience using JavaScript 
									which he has gained through online learning and experimentation.<br>
									<br>
									<b>Git 2.36.0</b><br>
									Source control will be employed through Git as it is an essential tool for keeping backups and track of changes in uDecide's code so that any bugs that 
									may arise can be traced back and in case of large enough bugs Git will allow for uDecide to be reverted to a previous version while the bug in question 
									is fixed. All members of uDecide have some experience with using Git for both their individual and group products.<br>
									<br>
									<b>GitHub - <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a></b><br>
									Git will be used in tandem with GitHub for uDecide's source control. JustDoIT will be able to work on uDecide simultaneously online using GitHub for 
									hosting uDecide's Git repository online. GitHub will also be used for hosting uDecide with GitHub pages hosting for static sites. Every member of uDecide 
									has experience and is able to make skillful use of GitHub for source control and online webpage hosting. 
								</p>

								<h4>Testing</h4>

								<p>
									The project will be heavily alpha tested by in-house developers and experts to ensure to fix obvious bugs and glitches that the application may have. This 
									will then get the application ready for a beta testing period of 3-5 weeks by real users to ensure that the application is validated in areas such as 
									usability, functionality, compatibility and reliability (testbytes 2019). This will help us understand where we go wrong and where we go right which 
									ultimately will help improve our application further and take us one step closer to release. There will be a mixture of people that will be beta testing 
									the product such as those who are technical and those who are for marketing purposes. The technical audience will give us constructive feedback and help 
									detect bugs that were missed during the alpha testing phase. The marketing audience will be those that have a higher social following to help increase 
									awareness of the application leading up to its release (Appteitive 2018). 
								</p>

								<h4>Timeframe</h4>

								<h4>Risks</h4>

								<p>
									In relation to uDecide, there are certain potential risks involved when developing the application. First off, the application may just not be valuable 
									to the users which can be due to the lack of research in the industry or developers ignoring end-users while developing the application.  As end-users 
									are ultimately the ones that are going to use the application, it is important that the individuals that are constructing the application are highly aware 
									of the task at hand to deliver the most optimal application possible in the end. The application can go all to waste if the application development is 
									approached from the wrong perspective causing eventually leading to no one using the app.<br>
									<br>
									Another risk can be poor UI/UX integration which is very important in the development of uDecide. It is crucial that uDecide has a user-friendly interface 
									with great user experience to have the application be of value to their daily needs. If not done properly there is a great risk of customer loss and 
									reputation damage once the application is released for all end-users (Creative Tim 2021).<br> 
									<br>
									Security breaches are another risk when developing uDecide. It is important for developers to take the appropriate security measures to create a safe 
									end-user experience and prevent things such as personal data being leaked or other confidential information. If not done correctly there will be potential 
									security risks that will damage the application’s reputation and end-user experience which will ultimately hurt the uDecide business (mrc 2013). <br>
									<br>
									There is a potential risk if uDecide is designed for many platforms at the same time. This can be costly and time consuming especially as uDecide is a 
									smaller business. The uDecide team must come to a decision on what platform to develop the application for at the beginning to save time and costs on 
									advertising and development (Creative Tim 2021).
								</p>

								<h4>Group processes and communications</h4>
								<p>
									We believe that communication is vital in a group. In this age there are a lot of ways to communicate it may confuse you to use a lot of means so in 
									communication we are using just Microsoft Teams and Outlook as means to connect us. Fazil creates emails to remind us of the time and day of videocall 
									meeting using Outlook for reminders and Microsoft Teams for videocall. We are arranging a two a week video call meeting so we can catch up to each 
									responsibility, but Jayden said that we must also use the chat system in Microsoft Teams for simultaneous work.<br>
									<br>
									In production the process dictates how long and how fast the product will be produced. If you have systematic processes, you will expect production to be 
									faster so processing in a group is important for us. In these assessments we did the 5 Process group which are Initiating Processes, Planning Process, 
									Executing Process, Controlling Process and Closing Process. We initiated the assessment by introducing ourselves to the requirements for the assessment 
									by reading the pdf given to us. The plan is each volunteered on which part of the assessment they are confident in doing. We believe the execution went 
									well considering all of us volunteered. At every meeting we are reminded of the responsibilities we have taken on and through chat also. As we end our 
									assessment, we are doing feedback for us to improve for the future projects.
