									  My name is Fazil Syed and I'm in team Just Do IT. I was born in Hyderabad, India
										and raised in Melbourne, Victoria where I currently reside with my beautiful wife and two young
										boys. My hobbies are cooking, fishing, traveling, watching movies/TV shows and DJing. I can speak
										both Hindi and Urdu. My interest in IT started at a very early age in the early 90's, and although
										I did do some IT studies approximately 20 years ago, I decided to follow a different career path. My
										interest in IT reignited recently whilst working on some IT related work projects and my own
										personal IT ideas. I felt helpless as I lacked the advanced tools, skills, and knowledge to achieve
										the desired outcome and expanding on the full potential of the work project and my personal ideas.
										My IT interest are based on the role of a Full Stack Developer, and I'm fascinated with the idea of
										automation and machine learning. These are the skills I'm hoping to gain during my Bachelor of IT
										at RMIT.<br>

									 (food, language, travelling). My interests in IT stem from growing up in a rural
									 town having to entertain myself, starting out in video games from as early as I can
									 remember to eventually taking every IT elective in high school and building computers
									 for fun. I've dabbled in coding in the past but haven't stuck with it long enough to
									 learn unfortunately. This is one of the main reasons I enrolled in RMIT to keep me
									 focused on something I love and enjoy, and hopefully in the future I can graduate
									 and begin a life-long career in the IT field.

									 It's my pleasure to introduce myself as Mina Roh. I migrated to Australia 14 years ago
									 from South Korea and I currently live in Melbourne, Victoria. I am a working mother of two young

									 areas of design. The inspiration to study IT came from studying big tech companies such as Apple,
									 Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla and Google to invest in US stocks. I became fascinated with their growth
									 and contributions to the creation of computer-generated value and prosperous technology. My particular
									 interest is cloud computing and cyber security, and I want to pursue a career in that field when
									 I graduate. At the moment, I have basic skills in HTML and CSS, but I would like to improve my
									 computer skills as well as my programming skills after completing my course.

										I am Ben Gabriel Barrios. I was born in Quezon City, Philippines.
										I arrived in Brisbane, Australia on the 12th of September 2021. I love pets and I've fostered a chicken,

										and even though I did not have my real father, my uncles and grandfather took care of me when
										my mother left for Israel so she can support us financially. My first time seeing a computer
										was when I was 8 years old in the care of my uncle who was an IT professor in a Cagayan State University
										in Sanchez Mira, Cagayan, Philippines. That is the first time I was amazed by a device that can
										do so much. My first love was the game Zuma by PopCap Games. My love for games gave me the interest
										to pursue IT program and I hope RMIT can help me. Currently, I have basic skills in HTML and CSS
										and would like to improve to achieve my dream of becoming a Web 3 Developer.<br>

							<h2>Group Processes</h2>

							<h3>Fazil</h3>
							<b>How well did your group work together in assessment 2?</b><br>
							<p>
								As a group, we worked exceptionally well together considering it was an auto allocated group. I believe the reason behind this success is due to the following:
							</p>
								<ul>
									<li>We all respected each other and our opinion.</li>
									<li>We were all very supportive in our group discussions and with ideas put forward.</li>
									<li>We share a common goal, that is, to obtain the highest possible grades in our assignment.</li>
									<li>We all had allocated tasks to complete and understood what needed to be done.</li>
									<li>There were no disagreements within the team.</li>
								</ul>

							<b>Will your work processes be changing for assessment 3?</b>
							<p>
								Although our work process towards A2 provided the best possible outcome, there's still room for improvements which we have jointly agreed that can put us in
								a better position with regards to A3. These are minor process changes that includes structuring our team meetings better with clear agendas, aim to complete
								our A3 in advance so that we're not rushing as we did on A2 and to communicate more proactively on MS Teams chat.
							</p>

							<h3>Philip</h3>
							<b>How well did your group work together in assessment 2?</b><br>
							<p>
								Our team worked incredibly well together from the start of the assessment to the very finish. We started off slowly since we were auto assigned and were not
								familiar with each other beforehand. This was only a problem until our first meeting as we immediately became friendly and started making jokes. This
								friendliness enabled us to work together fluently and openly, which increased our communication and overall work quality.
							</p>

							<b>Will your work processes be changing for assessment 3?</b>
							<p>
								I don't feel any changes are necessary in our workflow aside from having shorter meetings. Our strategies and workflow have served us well so far even under
								tight time constraints. I believe that since we are starting assessment three off with a familiar environment from assessment two, we will not have a slow
								start and instead be able to work efficiently from the start.
							</p>

							<h3>Jayden</h3>
							<b>How well did your group work together in assessment 2?</b><br>
							<p>
								Overall, I feel our team worked well on the project in its entirety. Our project was fully fleshed out and each team member's individual contributions were
								the reason for that. Even though we were randomly assigned, after our first meeting we were all much more comfortable together and carried that momentum into
								working on the project. Everyone was consistently present at the online meetings with only a few absences (myself included) and conversation was frequent in
								the MS Teams chat.
							</p>

							<b>Will your work processes be changing for assessment 3?</b>
							<p>
								Our process will remain the same for A3 with a few minor changes including:
								<ul>
									<li>More frequent updates through chat; using our meeting times less for updates and slimming the time needed for them down.</li>
									<li>Immediately starting repositories for GitHub and better maintaining of our shared word doc for individual efforts so that we can show activity log more accurately everyone's contributions. </li>
									<li>Requesting more feedback from lecturers earlier on to clarify issues earlier and spend less time trying to figure out what is required for us. </li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<h3>Mina</h3>
							<b>How well did your group work together in assessment 2?</b><br>
							<p>
								Our group was automatically assigned, but each team member took their own responsibilities and completed the assessment task with integrity. We could
								effectively finish assessment 2 with our creative thoughts and cooperative attitude. In this task as well, I expect that each of us will perform well in the
								division of work through various collaborations and role distribution.
							</p>

							<b>Will your work processes be changing for assessment 3?</b>
							<ul>
								<li>We plan to shorten our meeting times and make more use of chat and school emails for effective communication. </li>
								<li>Previously, after we finished writing work and did Github at the last stage. We ran out of time and rushed a lot. In this assessment, I expect to use the Github repository in the early stage. </li>
							</ul>

							<h3>Ben</h3>
							<b>How well did your group work together in assessment 2?</b><br>
							<p>
								In assessment 2 the group did work together well. Even though we are auto allocated in the group we did well in communication and given the fact that we 
								did not converse before we were allocated the group and from different classes. We are like longtime friends after breaking the ice. I am happy that the 
								team accepted each other's differences. Each of us took part in the assessment. 
							</p>

							<b>Will your work processes be changing for assessment 3?</b>
							<p>
								Active use of tools and introducing more tools for improvement. 
							</p>

							<h3>Cristian</h3>
							<b>How well did your group work together in assessment 2?</b><br>
							<p>
								In assignment 2, I felt like our team worked well considering we were automatically allocated and a week behind. I felt like we organised ourselves well 
								which was one of our strong points. There was plenty of communication throughout the team meeting and effective allocation of tasks. 
							</p>

							<b>Will your work processes be changing for assessment 3?</b>
							<p>
								We will be introducing a more structured team meeting schedule and collaborating more on certain parts of the assessment to achieve more consistency 
								through the project outline.

				<!-- Tools -->
				<section id="four" class="wrapper style3 fade-up">
					<div class="inner">
						<h2>Tools</h2>
						<p>
							<br>
							For the project as the methods used for the previous project, several tools were used to successfully complete the project. The most
							used tool was Microsoft Team, and it was used for smooth communication and planning among group members. The Microsoft team has helped
							us communicate without having to physically meet, no matter what distance we live. We regularly invited each team member and held
							meetings at least twice a week, in which we had time to present our collaborating work. And we used the platform to share and edit useful
							documents and necessary information. If there were members who missed the meeting, it is available to review the contents once again through
							our group meeting recordings and transcripts. And for clearer communication, we also used chatting to share necessary content and areas to be
							updated. The Microsoft team was a great communication tool for us, and we were able to share and communicate with each other wherever we were
							and at any time we wanted. We also used the Student Outlook E-mail as another communication tool to contact personally or to share information we need.
						</p>
						<p>
							<br>
							The other crucial tool used for the group project was Github and after adding the repository for the work to ultimately generate the website,
							it was hosted on Github pages. It was agreed to use the same website used in the previous project, and HTML/CSS templates were used to structure the
							website for the website creation, and the information and necessary contents for the requirements were added and formatted to the group project. For
							completing the website, the applicable Github page details are constructed to host the source code and present the project website.
           				</p>
            			<h2>Audit Trail</h2>
					 	<p>
						  	The tool that best reflects our collaborative process is Microsoft teams, and we conducted various collaborations through this platform. The Github repository
							isn't the best tool for reflecting our group projects. As before, we did our best to finish the written work first, and Github was used in the last stage.
							And there were team members who could quickly and accurately reflect on the repository, allowing other team members to focus more on other areas they are good at.

						<h2>IT Project</h2>
						 	<h3>Overview</h3>
								<h4>Topic</h4>

								<p>
								uDecide will be an extraordinary mobile and web-based application for sorting through entertainment from all streaming services the
								user is subscribed to so that they can easily find something worthwhile to watch. The user will be able to interact with the site on
								both their mobile devices and browser so that they are not restricted in accessing uDecide whatever platform they prefer to use.
								There will also be features for customizing what entertainment is shown on your browser or mobile device through manual filters that
								cover an array of different sections and categories. The user interface will aim to give essential data on the surface to minimize
								the need for constantly clicking through different pages and taking up more time than should be necessary for finding a movie or
								show to watch. Every movie and show on uDecide will also have an extremely useful feature which uses data from the largest rating
								and review websites like IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes to provide the user with an obvious way to tell whether their chosen entertainment
								is considered good or bad by the majority of watchers, which reduces the risk of the user having to sit through a movie and only find
								out it has bad writing, plot or acting after they finish watching it.
								</p>

								<p>
								Inside uDecide's catalogue will be movies and shows from every major streaming service in Australia which each have multiple points
								of information. One of the greatest ways uDecide helps you pick what you want to watch is through the people who have reviewed and
								or rated your chosen entertainment through IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes API's. There is also however greater information for quickly
								deciding on whether a movie or show is worth your time, such as likes and dislikes from fellow uDecide members and trailers that
								can be watched in app. uDecide also solves a big problem that comes with entertainment listings for kids. Multiple sections will be
								separated by age range which is a fantastic way to not just make the kids section usable for teenagers but also keep it friendly for
								younger kids who are not at an age to be left alone with the teenage content usually found in general kid's sections.
								</p>

								<h4>Motivation</h4>

								<p>
								The motivation behind uDecide stems from multiple problems with today's streaming service landscape. With such a large number of
								streaming services out there it is a frustrating time waster to have to keep switching between different applications with vastly
								different UI's, categories, filters, and search options. There is also little reliable information given about a certain movie or
								show on a streaming services platform which creates the need to find valuable information such as filters and reviews yourself. This
								tedious process makes the time it takes to find something you want to watch expand well beyond what is appropriate and starts
								ruining the experience a streaming service is meant to give you. This tedious process is the motivation behind uDecide, the annoying
								waste of time and effort just to find a simple movie or show is gone and now you have all your entertainment in one place with a way
								to search, filter and view ratings that trumps any streaming services ability to do so.
								</p>

								<h4>Landscape</h4>

								<p>
								Similar products such as 'Flickmetrix' are available let you browse all movies and help filter what your preferred movie might
								be, 'Rotten Tomatoes' is another entertainment scoring system that represents the percentage of critic reviews on a certain tv
								show or movie. Streaming services such as netflix offer a similar method of recommendation to a user where there is a user
								recommended rating on the movies home page. The products mentioned above all compete in the entertainment rating industry in
								their own unique ways however what remains special about Udecide is the integration of many different  streaming services and
								entertainment rating systems such as IMDb, Netflix and Rotten Tomatoes which is used in an application/website form to give a
								very detailed recommendation of user's entertainment preferences.
								</p>

							<h3>Description</h3>
								<h4>Aims</h4>

								<p>
								The aim of this project is to provide meaningful entertainment for viewers who use the TV guide of watching TV shows or movies through recommendations
								from uDecide. uDecide provides users with the information they need on any streaming services catalogue to decide on what they want to watch in a timely
								manner. Viewers can use uDecide with any Australian streaming service. uDecide's goal is to give viewers a high-quality TV streaming experience, which
								will be realized through easy access to information not found on streaming services. uDecide will guide the optimal service through various manual
								filters, categories and reviews recommended by other sites and analyze the audiovisual data of past they have seen.
								<br>
								<br>
								For uDecide's rating and reviews section to function there will need to be multiple API's for IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes and possibly others that request the
								required data to be displayed on the front end of the site. The API usage needs to be determined to limit the amount of requests to the bare minimum so
								that there is no cost of requesting ratings and review data. Due to the ratings and reviews coming from multiple API's there may be unequal usage to fit
								what we can use from each separate API.
								</p>

								<h4>Plans and Progress</h4>

								<b>Step 1: Problem Framing</b>
								<p>
									Our problem begins with a predicament that most people will have some experience with when it comes to the consumption of 
									streaming media. There are currently a multitude of streaming platforms available with the average user having access to 8.8 
									different streaming services (Anderson, 2022) which has the benefit of providing an endless amount of content to watch. 
									However, this creates the problem of making the decision to watch something take substantially longer. “A study by Ericsson 
									Consumer Lab found that the average US user spends approximately 23 minutes a day trying to find something to watch” 
									(Alexander, 2016). While current user bases vary in age from platform to platform, with the average user spending the 
									equivalent of an episode of a tv show on just deciding what to watch, what can we provide to users to help alleviate this issue?  
								</p>

								<b>Step 2: Draft Questions and User Interview</b>
								<p>
									In order to narrow down the problem to a specific issue that can be developed into some form of a product to help relieve this 
									issue, the best way forward would be to first interview a random group of individuals who use streaming services to identify 
									common trends and pain points. Some basic questions will be used to outline how users utilize these services and how they feel 
									about the amount of time spent searching for new media to watch. From these responses, we can analyze common problems and 
									themes and narrow down the problem to be researched and a solution developed. The following questions will be asked to gauge 
									how users feel about streaming services and any potentially outline any common negative trends. 
								</p>

								<table class="alt">
									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td><b>Question</b></td>
											<td><b>Purpose</b></td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>1. How do you feel about choosing new media to watch on streaming platforms?</td>
											<td>Generic question to establish broad feelings about services from the users.</td>

											</td>
										</tr>

								<b>Step 3: Outline a Common User</b>
								<p>
									The most common user group demographic for uDecide involves those from Generation Y (millennials aged 25-42 years) and 
									Generation Z (aged 7-25 years). According to statistics relating to similar competitors, most Netflix's users aged 18-54 years 
									old were (Stroll, 2022). Another similar competitor, Prime Video, found that the younger demographic seemed to be their most 
									frequent viewers on the Amazon giant's streaming platform (statista 2022). There is a common trend among the younger generation 
									being involved with streaming services online due to their close interaction with modern technology as well as their 
									familiarity with it. Generation Z are avid music goers and gamers with plenty of time on their hands, additionally being known 
									as the generation that is ever present on social media and the internet in general. Similarly, Generation Y are also savvy with 
									technology and heavily rely on communication through social media platforms. Most modern-day jobs also use the most up to date 
									technology forcing Generation Y to adapt to them. The characteristics of Generation Z and Y fit in well with the demographic 
									the uDecide wants to target. uDecide is the latest technological upgrade to streaming services serving the platform on new 
									modern technological devices such as smart TVs and touchscreen devices. The younger demographic has a large consumption of 
									entertainment daily, eventually ending up at a point of not knowing what movie or tv show they want to watch. This is the 
									problem the uDecide provides a solution to. With the frustration of not knowing what to watch anymore, the younger demographic 
									(gen z and y) can rely on uDecide to help them choose their source of entertainment with the help of a highly personalized 
									rating system tailored to the individual users.  
								</p>

								<b>Step 4: Research the Problem</b>
								<p>
									<b class="small-bold">User problems</b><br><br>
									uDecide needs to solve the problems that users have with streaming services regarding search effectiveness and time it takes to 
									search to be an effective product.
									<br><br>
									The survey results of the PwC Consumer Intelligence Series 2021 video survey show that the number three reason for 
									unsubscribing from a streaming service was due to the user having trouble finding what to watch. There are multiple problems 
									that can be addressed to challenge this issue users have and the first of these problems is how little information most 
									streaming services provide about their movies and shows that disable the user's ability to make more easily informed decisions 
									on what they want to watch. An over-arching time consumption problem also arises with how long it takes to sift through the 
									large catalogues of streaming services without a good method of getting to your ideal movies and shows quickly.
									<br><br>
									The first problems to address in relation to the user's difficulty in finding what to watch are what content the user views, 
									whether that content appeals to the user and how long the user can search through irrelevant content before becoming 
									frustrated. To minimize the difficulty a user experiences when searching through movies and shows a feature such as a varied 
									filter section that considers all of a user's desired preferences would be most useful. This will aid the user's problem of not 
									being able to find what to watch by giving them the ability to only view movies that fit their desired range of movie.
									<br><br>
									While manual filters can aid in a user's search through streaming service catalogue there is still a large problem with how 
									long it takes to find something to watch. Sometimes manual filters can make it harder to search for content as having too many 
									options can quickly become overwhelming. 31% of users value good and accurate recommendations and 29% of users are frustrated 
									by the large array of entertainment choices (PwC n.d). These statistics show that the best solution for gathering an audience 
									for uDecide is through a recommendation system that supplies the user with a movie or show without any effort on their part. 
									This solution will attract primarily the overlapping survey users who value recommendations and are frustrated by too many 
									options but can also attract users who only have one of these problems allowing over a third of streaming service users to be a 
									great target audience for this feature. 
								</p>

								<b class="small-bold">Competitors</b><br><br>
								<p>
									The solutions to these problems must not only effectively solve the problem but also go beyond competitor solutions and improve 
									or exceed what they have already achieved.
									<br><br>
									After researching possible competitors to our main idea, a few were identified. Keeping the constraints in mind, the top three 
									competitors to the project idea are as follows: On TV Tonight Pty Ltd.'s TV Guide Australia's phone app for iOS and Android, 
									and the two website-based guides CompareTV and JustWatch Australia. 
									<br><br>
									TV Guide Australia is the closest thing to a traditional format of browsing for upcoming media content through the broadcasted 
									Australian TV mediums (both free and paid TV). While not necessarily containing content from streaming platforms, it is still 
									beneficial to analyze and compare to this as it implements some concepts that would be beneficial to addressing the problem. TV 
									Guide Australia's app allowed users to see the schedules of upcoming media shown on the different TV networks. From then, users 
									could favorite shows that they enjoyed, keeping track of when they appeared next or be linked to the IMDB page for the media 
									to read more information.
									<br><br>
									CompareTV was another currently existing medium to consolidate the streaming services together in one place, also including the 
									Australian TV and sporting networks as well. Users could browse for their favorite TV shows or movies and receive a small 
									synopsis with links to IMDB for further information and probably the most important aspect of the CompareTV is that after 
									searching for a TV show or movie, it will display where you can watch the media. The limitation of this service is that it's 
									limited to the Australian population only as it only shows the Australian locations to watch said media, and thus not useful to 
									anyone outside the country.
									<br><br>
									The main product to compare to will be JustWatch, which provides a similar service to CompareTV focusing on streaming and not 
									traditional TV.  
								</p>

								<b class="small-bold">Constraints</b>

								<p>
									Certain limiting factors will need to be addressed throughout uDecide's planning and development to ensure that every feature 
									of uDecide is taken in a direction with an achievable and well thought out goal.
									<br><br>
									Finance will be a primary constraint to consider as without a way to make money through uDecide all money will have to come out 
									of the creators' pockets. Any sort of spending will have to be carefully analyzed and should only be done when strictly 
									necessary with constant observation to ensure only the bare minimum amount of money is spent. This strict spending will 
									directly affect API usage as some API's can cost money for one to two things. The first of these is how often you use the API 
									as while a lot of APIs have a certain amount of free uses you may eventually have to pay to go over that limit. The second 
									common API cost is the features it offers. If you pay a larger sum, you can gain access to more information and functions, you 
									can utilize the API for.
									<br><br>
									Time constraints also play an important role in the constraints of uDecide's development. The longer uDecide is worked on 
									without a useable product and monetary return for their work, the lower motivation will be and the closer uDecide may get to 
									being scrapped overtime. This inevitable point of having uDecide be scrapped due to either hitting some form of dead end or it 
									simply taking too long to achieve a finished product means that what time is spent on needs to be planned in advance so that 
									there is a structure to development beforehand and less time wastage throughout. Time constraints also intertwine with API 
									usage and time constraints as the longer time is spent on specifically development of the API's the more money will be needed 
									to keep development going which could have been potentially unnecessary with better planning beforehand.
								</p>

								<b>Step 5: Brainstorm the Solution</b>
								<p>
									uDecide can be taken in many different directions that could each be successful except in the end only one path can be chosen 
									for uDecide as it develops, evolves and becomes more and more fleshed out over time. uDecide is meant to be an application for 
									navigating streaming service catalogues and lowering the difficulty of choosing what to watch through multiple optional 
									methods. This means that there are lots of features that could potentially be useful for achieving this goal but not all of 
									them can be viably put into uDecide due to one or more limiting factors. 
									<br><br>
									The first and best idea to think about in uDecide's feature set for movie catalogue navigation is one that is simple, reliable 
									and hands off for the user. We can create a feature like this in multiple ways, but the most tried and true method is a 
									recommendation system that gives the user a movie or show picked out for them by the application so that they do not have to 
									put any effort into their entertainment choices and can instead relax and focus solely on enjoying their movie or show. A 
									recommendation system has multiple hidden layers behind it, but its complexity depends completely on its developers.  
									<br><br>
									The fastest and simplest method for a "recommendation system" would be a random movie or show picker that does not have any 
									complex logic behind it. While this would be simple to create it would not go well with the user base and could lead to large 
									user loss due to its inaccuracy and overall uselessness in choosing a movie or show the user might enjoy. Due to the scale and 
									variety in today's streaming service's catalogue's a random movie and show picker will not cut it when trying to sell uDecide 
									to users. 
									<br><br>
									A more refined version of this random choice "recommendation system" is one that incorporates some manual effort on the user's 
									part. If you supply the user with the ability to choose certain boundaries for the random choice function to work within such 
									as only choosing between movies with for example the "horror" category and was made between the years of 2000 - 2010, you can 
									gain a much more personalized recommendation through minor effort on the user's part. This, however, does not work well in most 
									cases because the previous usage assumed that the user knew exactly what area of movie or show they wanted to watch was. 
									Sometimes movie and show watchers do not have a particular type of entertainment in mind and just want something that appeals 
									to them without having to think about it for amounts of time that are large when considering they are just trying to choose 
									what to watch. 
									<br><br>
									The two previous features had their own individual benefits but only gained those benefits by sacrificing a separate aspect of 
									the user's enjoyment. The first recommendation system proposal was a completely random picker which was great at being fast and 
									requiring no effort on the user's part, did instead sacrifice all of its reliability and could take a completely random amount 
									of time from near no time at all to infinity and beyond for the user to find a movie they would enjoy watching. The next 
									iteration is a much more accurate recommendation which can give you good recommendations based on what types of entertainment 
									you like but sacrificed a lot in the time and effort a user needs to put in to achieve a desirable result. Both recommendation 
									systems lack an important aspect needed for them to be valued by users which is why a more advanced method is needed to achieve 
									desirable results. 
									<br><br>
									A recommendation system should not need to sacrifice either the user's effort or its own reliability if it is going to be a 
									good enough system to make the user happy. Therefore, the best way to create a recommendation system is through information, 
									the information being referred to is information pertaining to how the user uses the site and what their preferences are. This 
									is not supplied by the user manually but is instead automatically gathered from them overtime so that when they use the 
									recommendation system it can recommend to them what to watch automatically. The next part of the recommendation system is how 
									the information is used to generate what to watch. Instead of a random selector uDecide can use a machine learning algorithm 
									which takes in the automatically gathered user information and supply a recommendation through an intelligent decision made by 
									the machine learning algorithm. 
									<br><br>
									The previous ideas of what a recommendation system could look like do not have to go to waste just because they do not fit best 
									in the recommendation system feature. These ideas can be used as their own useful features that the user can choose to use 
									based on what they prefer at that time allowing for a more diverse experience for the user when they want to try something more 
									customized or watching something based on the role of a die. 
									<br><br>
									A natural feature to be extracted and refined from the previous recommendation system ideas is the random choice feature. If a 
									user ever wants to leave what they watch to mere chance whether that be for excitement or maybe because they are looking for 
									something out of their comfort zone they can easily do so. This feature will not just have one complete randomness setting 
									though, it can also incorporate the previously mentioned parameters that allow the user to narrow the zone in which the random 
									selector can select from giving a good balance to the user depending on what they feel in the mood for. 
									<br><br>
									With these ideas we can have multiple fleshed out ways to search for movies or shows that suit the user no matter how they like 
									searching for their entertainment. The recommendation system will be the primary way to search for a movie or show with its low 
									effort and reliable results but there will always be more manual personalized sections for people who would like a system that 
									allows them to choose their movie or show for themselves if they wish to. 
								</p>

								<b>Step 6: Draft Designing</b>
								<p>
									Before beginning initial designing of what our app will look like, it's first helpful to look at what the user flow without the 
									product looks like and analyze the pain points to see where the app can alleviate problems the user has along the way.  
								</p>
								<a href="images/plansAndProgress/plansProgress1.png" target="_blank">
									<div style="display: flex;justify-content: center;">
										<img class="image-default" src="images/plansAndProgress/plansProgress1.png" alt="Customer journey flow image" height="226px" width="720px">
									</div>
								</a>
								<p>
									From initial observations of using streaming services, the user flow is relatively simple. The user decides to watch media, 
									chooses a streaming platform to browse content, browses content to watch on said platform, watches media and optionally rates 
									the media after watching. We can see from this customer journey flow that there are several points in which the user must make 
									decisions from a wide list of possibilities which reduces the overall time spent watching content. This can lead to frustration 
									as generally media consumption is considered a leisurely action and the less time spent watching media equates with less 
									relaxation time.  
									<br><br>
									Our application will help alleviate user frustration with having to make different decisions at every stage by making an 
									all-in-one resource for finding new media to watch, as well as keeping track of what has been watched before. As well as 
									managing the different content available, the app will also integrate machine learning algorithms to analyze user watch history 
									and ratings and compare with other similar users to make recommendations for new media based on these metrics. From this, we 
									can alter the customer journey flow above to show what the experience would look like with the hypothetical application. 
								</p>
								<a href="images/plansAndProgress/plansProgress2.png" target="_blank">
									<div style="display: flex;justify-content: center;">
										<img class="image-default" src="images/plansAndProgress/plansProgress2.png" alt="Alternate customer journey flow image" height="194px" width="720px">
									</div>
								</a>

								<p>
									We can see that the alternate customer journey flow only varies in two places. However, considering that the majority of the 
									customer pain points will be in the time it takes to decide on what new or existing content to watch, the alternative will 
									leave the user with a more satisfied experience as the time taken between each of the steps will vary drastically. 
									<br><br>
									From this analysis, we can outline some features of the app that will be integral to the satisfaction of the user and overall 
									success. The most important features will be as follows: 
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Ability to make decisions immediately upon opening the app. </li>
									<li>A search feature that allows filtering content from an endless amount to an ideal one-page list of recommendations. </li>
									<li>
										The ability to display information about a selected media ranging from information regarding people involved (director, 
										actors, writers), various ratings from IMDB/RottenTomatoes/uDecide internal ratings, on which streaming service it can be 
										viewed on and content that is similar.
									</li>
									<li>
										An option to allow the machine learning algorithm to decide for the user where the user selects from a type of media 
										(movie, TV show, animation, and kids) and will be given a recommendation suited to the content selected.
									</li>
									<li>
										A recommendation page that prompts users to answer a small number of questions after watching content to provide a user 
										rating for content as well as helping to refine the machine learning algorithms.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									We can use this information to create a rough flow of what the application will look like and create a rough layout to be 
									fleshed out in future stages of the project.
								</p>

								<b>Step 7: Rough Design Mock-Ups</b>
								<p>
									Using the above frame to base our app design on, we can begin to create a prototype of what the app will look like using Figma. 
									Figma is a powerful vector graphics editor and collaborative designing application that will allow us to create prototypes that 
									will reflect how users will use our app. This is vital to the success of the project as it allows us to continually work on a 
									design that can be modified to fit the needs of the user outlined above before having to commit to developing. Changes to the 
									structure, layout and flow of the app can be handled easier in Figma than they could using development tools at this stage of 
									the project. 
									<br><br>
									The rough outline mentioned above was converted into a Figma design with a design flow that mimics how a user would natively 
									flow through the application. Beginning at a homepage that immediately gives the user options to find a new, random piece of 
									media to watch or new or existing content to watch, the user only needs to so much as open the app and tap on one option to be 
									taken to an information page for something to watch and where to find it. If the user decides to browse for something, there is 
									a navigation menu on the bottom that takes the user to their previously liked content, a search option with various filters to 
									aid in narrowing down the selection and a random option that utilizes machine learning to make predictive decisions for the 
									user. Another thing that was added to the app flow was a feedback page that prompts the user after a set amount of time after 
									watching new media to answer a small number of questions that will help refine the learning algorithm and be used to provide a 
									uDecide based rating score on the media pages.

								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Step 8: Extended Timeframe</b>
								<p>
									Once all the research has been done on market reliability, the next 10 weeks will involve the development of the product. The uDecide team can begin 
									to finalize application designs and start to work on making the product into reality. This is where we also begin one of the most important steps in 
									the whole process of application development, marketing. It's important that during these 10 weeks that we develop an in-depth marketing plan and 
									invest in app marketing analytic software to better understand how to target our audience and tailor their needs to the application. Our team will 
									begin to create the necessary social media pages and design the websites that associate with uDecide. Once the necessary research and marketing has 
									been done, we can now proceed to building the application with the necessary coding which will take up much more than 10 weeks.  
								</p>
								
								<h4>Roles</h4>
								<b>Performance Marketing Manager</b>
								<br>
								<p>
									The role of the marketing manager is important to the success of the TV guide project. This role will perform significant tasks of connecting the 
									latest releases and popular movies or TV shows provided by various streaming companies such as Netflix, Disney Plus, and Amazon Prime TV. In addition, 
									it is necessary to understand the demand of users through market research and to collect meaningful data to provide high-quality content that can be 
									realized to customers. For this role, communication skills for interacting with other companies are essential, and market research skills are helpful. 
									In addition, it is necessary to understand the tools are related in this industry such as Google Ads, GDN, Facebook Business Manager and DV 360. It 
									is also required to have experience with BI tools like PowerBi or Google Datastudio. (Jobs.lever.co, 2022) 
								</p>

								<b>Software Engineer-Tooling & Core infrastructure</b>
								<br>
								<p>
									In u Decide, a software engineer will build and design the software and form a system to provide a variety of contents by building tools to deliver 
									code to users all over the world. It is necessary to keep track of the core web vitals to improve the performance of u Decide. (Join.com, 2022) The 
									software engineer will perform to migrate data from its own hosting to the cloud, which helps the server reliability and serves users quickly. As 
									cloud services offer a portfolio of hundreds of recyclable services, like Lego blocks, so they can use a combination of cloud services with a variety 
									of service functions, including video conversion, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI) recommendation engines. The design of a web 
									router is needed as a "user-face-to-face" component to reduce the loading time of the site. The stacks required for u Decide will be realized in the 
									cloud, and this role will play an essential role in shaping and advancing this technology stack. (Join.com, 2022) 
								</p>

								<b>Senior Web User Interface Engineer</b>
								<br>
								<p>
									Web user interface engineers are necessary for this project to provide convenience for users by doing interaction with all relevant web pages and 
									screens while utilizing an app or a website. These engineers should have knowledge and skills dealing with HTML, CSS, HTTP, and JavaScript. It is 
									required to have front-end development experience. (UserTesting. 2022) 
								</p>

								<b>Senior Web User Interface Designer</b>
								<br>
								<p>
									UI Designers are necessary to design and create the user interface that is necessary from the user's point of view. It will play a key role in building 
									and designing the visual elements needed to use the Web and make the website effective and easy to use. It involves organizing information throughout 
									the website, and building prototypes that UI designers can use to activate the experience with aesthetic prosperity. (The Jotform Blog. 2022) 
								</p>

								<b>A Senior System Administrator</b>
								<p>
									Senior system administrators are required to professionally supervise the necessary system operations in u Decide. The tasks required are to monitor 
									the performance of hardware and software, configure the system, install the server, and check that the related technical aspects are operating smoothly. 
									They can try to maximize the efficiency of the IT infrastructure and ensures security.(Zippia.com. 2022) 
								</p>

								<h4>Scope and Limits</h4>

								<p>
								The scope of uDecide is currently limited to the most realistically implementable features with our current time and skill set. The first deliverable
								will be a skeleton project that contains the planned UI (User Interface) and a mock movie catalogue created using Figma. Figma will allow for a large
								focus to be put into the UI of uDecide which is extremely important due to the necessity to display information in a quickly interpretable format for the
								users such as ratings, reviews, title, etc. The reason a clean and informational UI is so important is to cut down the need to click forward and back
								through pages which can cause built up time spent just waiting for a site page to load. The next and one of the most important deliverables is a basic
								HTML/CSS website inspired by the Figma skeleton that is hosted on GitHub pages which allows for online access. This site will contain a large enough
								number of movies and shows that uDecide's features can be displayed on a scale that will give someone an idea of what the finished product will be like.
								The star feature of this simple version one of uDecide is its usage of API's for displaying ratings and reviews for the user to consider when deciding on
								what to watch.
								</p>

								<p>
								With the time constraints and the currently limited skills of our team there are many features that will not be implemented in uDecide's version one
								showcase. The first of these is the machine learning algorithm that uses user data gathered through their site usage to generate recommendations that are
								accurate most of the time. Next is web scraping content from all the streaming services catalogues we wish to list on uDecide, which would also affect the
								API usage as some APIs (application program interfaces) have a cost to use over a certain amount of times causing the API to be near useless with little
								information being able to be displayed not considering multiple users. Finally, the manual filters section will also be unachievable since most of our time
								needs to be put into the core features of uDecide and jamming in more than the bare minimum will result in a lower quality product.

								</p>

								<h4>Testing</h4>

								<p>
									The project will be heavily alpha tested by in-house developers and experts to ensure to fix obvious bugs and glitches that the application may have. This
									will then get the application ready for a beta testing period of 3-5 weeks by real users to ensure that the application is validated in areas such as
									usability, functionality, compatibility and reliability (testbytes 2019). This will help us understand where we go wrong and where we go right which
									ultimately will help improve our application further and take us one step closer to release. There will be a mixture of people that will be beta testing
									the product such as those who are technical and those who are for marketing purposes. The technical audience will give us constructive feedback and help
									detect bugs that were missed during the alpha testing phase. The marketing audience will be those that have a higher social following to help increase
									awareness of the application leading up to its release (Appteitive 2018).
								</p>

								<h4>Timeframe</h4>

								<a href="images/timeFrame/TimeFrameFinal.png" target="blank_">
									<img class="image-default" src="images/timeFrame/TimeFrameFinal.png" alt="Time frame demonstration.">
								</a>

								<h4>Risks</h4>

								<p>
									In relation to uDecide, there are certain potential risks involved when developing the application. First off, the application may just not be valuable
									to the users which can be due to the lack of research in the industry or developers ignoring end-users while developing the application.  As end-users
									are ultimately the ones that are going to use the application, it is important that the individuals that are constructing the application are highly aware
									of the task at hand to deliver the most optimal application possible in the end. The application can go all to waste if the application development is
									approached from the wrong perspective causing eventually leading to no one using the app.<br>
									<br>
									Another risk can be poor UI/UX integration which is very important in the development of uDecide. It is crucial that uDecide has a user-friendly interface
									with great user experience to have the application be of value to their daily needs. If not done properly there is a great risk of customer loss and
									reputation damage once the application is released for all end-users (Creative Tim 2021).<br>
									<br>
									Security breaches are another risk when developing uDecide. It is important for developers to take the appropriate security measures to create a safe
									end-user experience and prevent things such as personal data being leaked or other confidential information. If not done correctly there will be potential
									security risks that will damage the application's reputation and end-user experience which will ultimately hurt the uDecide business (mrc 2013). <br>
									<br>
									There is a potential risk if uDecide is designed for many platforms at the same time. This can be costly and time consuming especially as uDecide is a
									smaller business. The uDecide team must come to a decision on what platform to develop the application for at the beginning to save time and costs on
									advertising and development (Creative Tim 2021).
								</p>

								<h4>Group processes and communications</h4>
								<p>
									We believe that communication is vital in a group. In this age there are a lot of ways to communicate it may confuse you to use a lot of means so in
									communication we are using just Microsoft Teams and Outlook as means to connect us. Fazil creates emails to remind us of the time and day of videocall
									meeting using Outlook for reminders and Microsoft Teams for videocall. We are arranging a two a week video call meeting so we can catch up to each
									responsibility, but Jayden said that we must also use the chat system in Microsoft Teams for simultaneous work.<br>
									<br>
									In production the process dictates how long and how fast the product will be produced. If you have systematic processes, you will expect production to be
									faster so processing in a group is important for us. In these assessments we did the 5 Process group which are Initiating Processes, Planning Process,
									Executing Process, Controlling Process and Closing Process. We initiated the assessment by introducing ourselves to the requirements for the assessment
									by reading the pdf given to us. The plan is each volunteered on which part of the assessment they are confident in doing. We believe the execution went
									well considering all of us volunteered. At every meeting we are reminded of the responsibilities we have taken on and through chat also. As we end our
									assessment, we are doing feedback for us to improve for the future projects.

						<h2>Group Reflection</h2>

						<h3>Individual</h3>

						<b>Philip</b>
						<p>
							I think our group has worked extremely well together throughout the duration of this assessment, we have successfully completed the 
							tasks of this assessment through delegation and effective communication while continually accounting for everyone's needs. Our group 
							members are also all open to each other's ideas, which has allowed us to create a better assessment through the consideration of 
							everyone's thoughts on what should be done. Everybody's consideration and effort put into their work has made our assessment what it 
							is. I think our group may need to take the time to learn how to use all the resources that are essential for the completion of our 
							assessment as all of us being able to effectively use all the tools we require will allow us to be more efficient in the completion of 
							our work. I am surprised at how well we manage to come together and complete work even in times of stress and strict time limits. 
							Through delegation and good communication, we can work through these tough times and come out stronger as a team. I have learned that 
							even when everything seems to be in order, you never know whether an illness or some other type of trouble will come your way and ruin 
							your plans and order.
						</p>

						<b>Cristian</b>
						<p>
                            Our group has worked efficiently throughout assessment three, we made sure to work on what we needed to work on as a group to improve
							our output of work. Effective task delegation was in full effect making sure everyone was atoned to their strengths and helped on their
							weaknesses.  There is room from improvement for most of our group when it came to certain technological aspects of the assignment
							however, we made sure to include everyone and assist their learning however possible. Most of our group were put in tough situations
							throughout this assignment however I'm proud that we were still able to effectively communicate and get together in the end to
							complete it. I learnt that you could rely on your teammates during stressful times and that they always got your back. 
						</p>

						<b>Mina</b>
						<p>
							Through the group progress, all team members contributed to work with integrity to achieve the goal for successful completion of the 
							assessment 3. During the meeting, we had an opportunity to outline the questions from different perspective and I was able to refine 
							understanding by explanation and discussion from the other members if there were not clear parts.  With full responsibility, everyone 
							took their divided tasks by their choices without hesitance and then concentrated on tasks to complete it within our timeline. We could 
							complete our work well on our weekly timeline, motivating each other and helping each other out. I was able to collaborate successfully 
							in supportive and warm environments and I could express my opinions more freely. The field that can be further developed seems to 
							require practice not to repeat the same story by setting a clearer agenda for each meeting. The most surprising thing was that through 
							many meetings, if trust the team members and strong bonds were formed, allowing me to focus more on the group project more.  I felt 
							most while working on this project was that I learned that teamwork could increase productivity for group projects and work in harmony 
							could drive me towards to common goal.  
						</p>

						<b>Fazil</b>
						<p>
							I’m very pleased with the way we all worked together as a team on Assessment 3 (A3). We have now worked together for almost eight (8) 
							weeks and built a strong understanding of each other and our team’s goal. This has ensured that our project is progressed through is 
							the most efficient and effective manner.  What I appreciate most is the way we are all very encouraging, engaging, supportive and 
							respectful towards each other, our ideas and contribution.  
							<br><br>
							Although we had a more time for our A3 submission than assessment 2 (A2), I believe there’s still room for improvement with regards to 
							time management. This is what was most surprising for me as we went from a position where we had plenty of time to then be in a 
							position where we are running out of time.  
							<br><br>
							Working with Team Just Do IT! for almost eight (8) weeks, I’ve learnt the key to any successfully team is through effective 
							communication, support, respect, and teamwork. These are main reason why I believe our team worked so well.   
						</p>

						<b>Jayden</b>
						<p>
							Similarly to A2, our group worked really well together on every aspect of this project. We were consistent with making meetings, even 
							though we started relatively late in the term for this project we didn’t feel overly stressed about not having enough done and I’m as 
							confident as that we handled this as well as we did in A2. This time, we talked more in MS Teams instead of saving all our updates for 
							the group meetings and this stopped us hitting bottlenecks where we had our weeks work completed but didn’t know what to work on until 
							the next meeting. The only thing that I think we could improve of, is to agree earlier on how things are going to be designed. This 
							way, we don’t waste as much time changing the structure of certain things too many times before landing on a final product. The main 
							takeaway from working in this group was how important communication really is to succeed. From the very first meeting, we were up front 
							about what our expectations were and continually maintained contact in meetings and eventually, MS Teams chat. 
						</p>
							
						<h3>Group</h3>

						<p>
							In order to achieve the goal of successfully completing the project, all team members worked intensively by dividing each task. As 
							before, we used Microsoft Team as a communication tool and met regularly twice a week to update each other's divided work and asked 
							feedback on the results of our own tasks from each other. Most of the members were active in meetings, kept their appointments on time, 
							and shared valuable information they wanted and expressed their opinions freely. The difference from before was that we asked each 
							other's well-being and daily life during greeting, and even after the group assignment meeting was finished, we had time to get to know 
							each other by sharing opinions on how to study and what plans we have in the future. This created an atmosphere where we could freely 
							present any opinions through psychological stability, even if this conversation were not related to the group project, and this allowed 
							us to concentrate on our group project even more. We willingly took the part we were good at and shared our progress with each other 
							through meetings or chatting. With this collaboration, this project was able to proceed effectively and quickly. Active interaction 
							occurred through collaboration and teamwork between team members, which became the driving force for the smooth execution of the 
							project. We further shortened the meeting time by reflecting on the improvements made in the previous project, which seems to have been 
							more efficient in the progress of the project. The direction we can improve is that there was a team member who listened quietly during 
							the team meeting, so if other members actively asked open ended questions and participated with more warmth and encouragement, it would 
							be better if that team member expressed his opinions without shyness. What was surprising while working on a group project was that 
							every team member has their own strength, and we were able to combine the specific skills, information, and experiences of other team 
							members to bring the best outcome. We learned how to plan and organize through group work and acquired time management skills to use 
							time efficiently in completing a project. We also learned that even difficult and complex problems can be easily solved by a group of 
							people working together and using their own exceptional skills, knowledge, and abilities. We could improve our problem-solving skills 
							by allowing brainstorming and collaboration to complete our tasks successfully and increase creativity.
